This is the code and analysis for this article. 

Journal Article is: Richard Allen White III, Jeff Norman, Emily E. Mclachlan, Joseph P. Dunham, Aaron Garoutte, Maren L. Friesen **The draft genome sequence for type strain *Ideonella azotifigens* DSMZ21438, a novel aerobic diazotroph of the Betaproteobacteria isolated from grass rhizosphere soil.** *Microbiology Resource Announcements (MRA).* 

**Analysis**

This repo holds a workflow script to process Illumina sequencing read data with quality trimming and removal of phiX174, *de novo* genome assembly of quality controlled sequence reads and to annotate the genome. 

**Data**

Raw and quality controls reads, assemblies, and annotations are also at Open Science Framework (OSF) repo [link](https://osf.io/r9y3g/)<br />
NCBI GenBank BioProject number is PRJNA550449 [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA550449/)
